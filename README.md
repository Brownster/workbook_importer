# YAML to CSV Converter

This Python script converts YAML files to CSV format. The script is designed to handle a specific YAML structure, used for describing network configurations and service details, and convert it into a CSV file with a defined set of fields. This tool is particularly useful for network administrators and engineers who need to convert complex configuration files into an easy-to-read format.

## Features

- Handles multiple YAML structures including OS exporters, application exporters, blackbox exporters, and SSL exporters.
- Supports multiple exporter types with varying details.
- Produces a CSV output with a predefined set of fields.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyYAML library

## Usage

Command line usage:

python yaml_to_csv.py <input_yaml_file> <output_csv_file>

python

Replace `<input_yaml_file>` with the path to your input YAML file, and `<output_csv_file>` with the path where you want the CSV file to be saved.

## Example

Given an input YAML file `input.yaml`, you can convert it to CSV format with the following command:

```bash
python yaml_to_csv.py input.yaml output.csv
