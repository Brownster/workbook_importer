YAML to CSV Converter

This Python script converts YAML files with system and network settings into a CSV file format.
Dependencies

The script uses the following libraries:

    csv
    yaml

These can be installed using pip:

shell

pip install pyyaml

Usage

The script can be used as follows:

shell

python script_name.py

Replace script_name.py with the name of your Python script. Before running the script, make sure to replace 'your_yaml_file.yaml' with the name of your YAML file in the script.
Description

The script consists of the following functions:

    create_row: Generates a dictionary object with predefined keys and values fetched from a 'details' dictionary.
    handle_exporter: Iterates over a dictionary representing specific exporter data, calls the create_row function on each item, and appends the result to a list.
    convert_yaml_to_csv: First, it loads a YAML file's contents into a dictionary. Then, it creates an empty list that will eventually contain all rows for the CSV file. It constructs a dictionary with predefined keys that represent different exporters' data from the YAML file. It iterates over this dictionary and, based on the type of exporter, calls the handle_exporter function with different parameters. Finally, the CSV data is returned.

The script also writes the collected data to a CSV file using the csv library's csv.DictWriter class.
